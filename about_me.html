        	<h1>About Me</h1>
        	<p>I'm attending Louisiana Tech University to obtain my Bachelor's degree in Cyber Engineering. It's a combination of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with additional courses on Security, Ethics, and Law. I've participated in Louisiana Tech's CyberStorm hacking competition by creating a challenge for the teams to attempt, by creating an Android app used in the competition, and as a member of one of the hacking teams. I've done the IEEEXtreme 24-hour Programming Competition.</p>
        	<br>
        	<p>In my free time, I love working on things. This page is actually hosted on a VPS I'm renting which holds many of my projects including some javascript/python bots (check my GitHub for more info!), this web server, and a VPN configuration. My hobbies include coding, security, embedded systems, cars, motorcycles, hardware, electronics, and much more. I become absorbed with anything I can tinker with. I've done a range of things including assembly languages, data scraping webpages, 3-d printing parts for my car, wiring houses/commercial buildings, and welding together parts for my bike.</p>

    				<p>This car is a constant work in progress. So far, I've made it road-worthy again, fixed some rust issues, and converted from the ancient unreliable fuel-injection system to some awesome vintage SU carburators. I've also installed some custom designed 3-d printed velocity stacks on those carbs!</p>
    				<p>The story behind obtaining the Z is interesting. I bought a junker motorcycle and repaired it, which I then traded for a 1992 Nissan 240sx. I then proceeded to drive the 240sx for a year while I fixed it up. I found one of my dream cars, the Z, on craigslist and traded the 240sx for it. I effectively bought one of my favorite cars for a $1500 motorcycle!</p>

    				<p>I've designed and welded the handlebars and sissy bar for this bike. Some other modifications include chopping the rear fender, a good bit of simplified wiring, old-school seat, vintage spec tube tires, and some shorter(and stiffer) shocks.
